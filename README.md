# amazon

A super fun Node based "Amazon" - like app where I use my slowly-growing programming skills to deliver a slightly wonky-shopping experience.

How do I use it?
When you open the app, you will see a list of available products, and you will be prompted to answer 2 questions:
1. "What item do you want to purchase?"
2. "How many do you want to purchase?"

If you enter an invalid ID, or try to purchase more of an item than we have in stock, you will receive an error message and be prompted to try again.

If we have sufficient quantities of the item you try to purchase, you will be informed of a successful purchase and told of the sale price. (And hopefully, the back-end SQL database will update as well.)


Developers note:
I overcame some huge roadblocks here with my understanding of Node and MySQL. Things might not work perfectly yet, but its darn close, and following the directions given on the assignment, I am stopping my work here after 14 hours. (Suggested stopping after 10 in the directions.)
